    Born: Year Zero, Garden of Eden 45
Died: Year 930 45 in the land of Shulon 9

AKA:

Adama
Adapa
Atab
Atabba
Facts:

Genesis 2:7 – God created Adam.
Married Eve (AKA: Ava, Eve of Elda, Nin-Khawa, Hawah)
Genesis 5:3 – When Adam was 130 years old, Seth, his third son, was born.
Genesis 5:4 – Adam and Eve had other children.
Genesis 5:5 – Adam lived 930 years.
When God created Adam on the sixth day, He gave Adam dominion over all life on Earth.

“… rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.” 45

Not only would man rule over it, but “subdue it.” 45

God brought each pair of animals to Adam, who exercised his authority for the first time by naming every creature.45

The Wedding

After watching Adam name each pair, male and female, it must have occured to God that He hadn’t yet created a mate for Adam. After creating everything else and declaring every single bit of it “good,” God observed, for the first time, something was “not good” – the man being alone. God put the man into a deep sleep. Whereas He created the man by taking some of the Earth – one of the elements – God created the woman by taking some of the man.45

The man was no longer whole until, after waking up, God presented the woman to Adam. Some see this God uniting Adam and his bride in the “first marriage” but, given that God created her by removing part of Adam – making him incomplete – God didn’t unite them but reunited them, making them complete. Some see marriage as putting two people into a state of “one flesh” but I see it as returning them to a state of “one flesh.”

Adam’s precise age at the “wedding” is unknown but it isn’t an unreasonable assumption that they were married the day of her creation.

The Fall

What I find particularly interesting about the young bride’s temptation is that she wasn’t at all surprised when a snake spoke to her.

After things turned for the worst and God reveals the consequences to each of the guilty parties, she is told, among other things, “your husband … will rule over you.” 45

As soon as God is finished speaking, Adam exercises his newly granted dominion over the woman – and names her.

Then Adam and his Eve left the garden.

The Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve

Keating states with confidence in his Complete History of Ireland that Adam was 15 years old when Cain and Calmiapa, his first son and daughter, were born. Fifteen years later, Able and Delbora, Adam’s second son and daughter were born. 17

According to Joseph Smith, Adam & Eve taught their children to read and write.9 Perhaps it’s just me, but that rather begs the question what they were reading. They may have read the books that, also according to Smith , Adam wrote such as a book of remembrance and a genealogy book.9

After the first two sets of twins 17, Awan – their third daughter – was born (Book of Jubilees 4:1). She grows up to marry Cain (Book of Jubilees 4:9) – a wedding I’m sure Adam & Eve weren’t exactly thrilled with. 25

The conception and birth of Adam’s third child, Seth, is recorded in Genesis 4:25 and Genesis 5:3 states Adam’s son, Seth, was “a son in his own likeness, in his own image.” 45 Adam was 130 years old.

Azura is born (Book of Jubilees 4:8) after Seth – the man she’ll marry (Book of Jubilees 4:11). 25

Adam had many other children and lived a total of 930 years. 45

Adam was, according to Jubilees 4:29, the first man buried in the Earth. 25 This begs the question – what happened to Abel’s body?

Children of Adam and Eve include (in order of birth):

Cain 45 and Calmiapa (twins) 17
Abel 45 and Delbora (twins) 17
Awan (wife of Cain, mother of Cain’s son, Enoch) 25
Sheth
Azura (wife of Seth) 25
