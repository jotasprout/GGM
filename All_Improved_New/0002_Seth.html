Adam > Seth

AKA:

Sheth– cite
Set– cite
Sed– cite
Sat-naal– cite
Born: Olaha, Shinehah– cite
Died: at age 912 in Cainan, East Eden, Mesopotamia – cite

Married:

Azura, mother of Enos (Book of Jubilees 4:11) 25
Facts:

Seth’s conception and birth is recorded in Genesis 4:25 when Eve says God gave Seth as a replacement for Abel and Genesis 5:3 states he was a son in his father’s own likeness and image. 45
Seth’s name means “put, placed, set” (Gill’s Exposition of the Entire Bible) as opposed to Cain, the “restless wanderer,” who was banished to the Land of Nod – “Nod” meaning “wandering.” 45
I really like this quote: “What Cain (human wickedness) took from her, that has Elohim (divine omnipotence) restored.” 46
Children:

Enos (AKA: Enosh) 45
Noam 25
